# MLHEP 2020 Calorimeter regression

This challenge is aimed to recover the particle initial position and momentum in LHCb calorimeter. 


The calorimeter system is designed to stop particles as they pass through the detector, measuring the amount of energy lost as each one grinds to a halt. Two types of calorimeter are used at LHCb.


The electromagnetic calorimeter is responsible for measuring the energy of lighter particles, such as electrons and photons, while the experiment's hadron calorimeter samples the energy of protons, neutrons and other particles containing quarks.
